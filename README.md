# Ferrytime

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

[Ferrytime](https://ferryti.me) is a simple webapp to track the schedule of the BC Ferries.

I've spent years of my life travelling on the coastal ferries to visit family, meet up with friends, and commute for work and school.

I've always found the official site difficult to navigate: either showing me too much information or just not enough.

I made Ferrytime clean, simple, and fast to make my travels easier. Hopefully it helps you too!

What began as a styled HTML table ended up becoming a continuously changing learning environment for front-end development.

## Features

- Consolidates all relevant route information on a single page
- Users can add favourite routes
- Progressive Web App allows for offline viewing
- Colored tags for sailings in progress, delayed, or cancelled.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
