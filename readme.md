# Ferrytime

A simple ~~website~~ webapp to track the schedule of the BC Ferries.

What began as a re-styled HTML table ended up becoming a continuously changing learning environment for front-end development.

## History 
- Started in Ruby with Sinatra and Twitter Bootstrap (2013)
- Re-wrote everything in Node, Express, and Handlebars (2017)
- Tried writing JSON to disk for a lightweight DB solution (2018)
- Moved to SQLite3 and Sequelize 
- Added React as a front-end framework with Styled-Components for CSS
- Moved to Postgres for Database with RESTful backend
- Tried using Knex as ORM
- Fell back to using pg-promise and writing SQL for simplicity
- Rewrote entire backend for hosted Mongodb (mLab) and Graphql


## TODO
- Not all sailings show
- Merge results of second scraper
- Fix frontend styling
