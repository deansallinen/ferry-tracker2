# Ferrytime

[Ferrytime](https://ferryti.me) is a simple webapp to track the schedule of the BC Ferries. 

I've spent years of my life travelling on the coastal ferries to visit family, meet up with friends, and commute for work and school. 

I've always found the official site difficult to navigate: either showing me too much information or just not enough. 

I made Ferrytime clean, simple, and fast to make my travels easier. Hopefully it helps you too!

What began as a styled HTML table ended up becoming a continuously changing learning environment for front-end development.
